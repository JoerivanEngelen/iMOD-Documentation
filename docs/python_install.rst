The recommended way of installing iMOD Python is by running the Deltaforge
installer. :ref:`Read the installation instructions here <deltaforge-install>`.

For other ways to install iMOD Python, see the documentation here:
https://deltares.gitlab.io/imod/imod-python/installation.html

iMOD Python has no point release schedule, but instead has a "rolling release",
where the package is frequently updated. Therefore we advice doing a
`development install.
